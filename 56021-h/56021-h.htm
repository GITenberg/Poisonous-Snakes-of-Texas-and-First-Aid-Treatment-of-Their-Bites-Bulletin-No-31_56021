<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p>This Bulletin has been prepared in response to many requests
from hunters, ranchers, telephone construction personnel, Boy Scouts
and others who spend much time outdoors, for a concise and illustrated
guide to the poisonous snakes of Texas. The information
presented is merely an outline of the poisonous snakes found
within the state and is not intended to replace the several excellent
snake books now on the market.</p>
<p>Sixteen species and subspecies of poisonous snakes, belonging
to four general groups, are found in Texas. The most characteristic
features of each are described. A photograph accompanies each
description and a map indicating the snake&rsquo;s known range by counties
is included. With this information, the reader should have
little difficulty recognizing the poisonous snakes found in his region
and, should he be required to render first aid for snake bite, the
text and photos covering this subject will help him to do the job
successfully.</p>
<p>A number of persons have extended help during the current revision
of this booklet. I am most indebted to Alvin Flury, information
and education officer for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department,
who not only did much of the necessary legwork for the project,
but who also provided the impetus that saw it to completion.
Thanks are due also to the following persons for county records
of poisonous snakes in Texas: Ralph W. Axtell, Richard J. Baldauf,
Edward W. Bonn, Bryce C. Brown, James R. Dixon, Alvin Flury,
John W. Forsyth, W. C. Glazener, W. Grainger Hunt, L. M. Klauber,
Verlin Nethery, Floyd Potter, Kirk Preston, Stephen Preston, Gerald
G. Raun, Michael Sabath, Joe T. Stevens, Ernest C. Tanzer, Donald
W. Tinkle, Clay Touchstone and John Wooters. Live specimens
for making photographs used here were provided by Russell J.
Long, Rusty Martin, Ernest C. Tanzer, Clay Touchstone and Lawrence

<h1 title="">POISONOUS SNAKES OF TEXAS
<br />AND FIRST AID TREATMENT
<br />OF THEIR BITES</h1>
<p>It is widely known among snake bite authorities that more persons
die from snake bite in Texas than in any other state of the nation.
This startling fact should encourage every Texan to obtain a
thorough working knowledge of the correct first aid treatment for
snake bite so he will be prepared to act promptly in the event
of an emergency. In addition, and perhaps just as important, he
should learn how to prevent a bite before it can happen. This
means knowing where to expect poisonous snakes, how to avoid
them, and how to identify on sight the venomous kinds found
in the region where he lives.</p>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">PRECAUTIONS AT HOME</span></h2>
<p>Statistics show that a large percentage of all bites takes place near
the home and more than a few of these are inflicted upon small
children playing in their yards. Therefore, let us consider first
the possible presence of poisonous snakes around the home and some
precautions that can be taken to keep them away.</p>
<p>Each year Texas zoos receive calls from distressed home owners
within city limits who have discovered rattlesnakes or copperheads
under their houses or beneath trash piles on their property. These
people ask for assistance in the removal of the snakes or for advice
which may prevent similar future invasions. The trespassing snake
often can be disposed of quickly, but the removal of one snake does
not always solve the problem. Something must be done to discourage
other snakes from taking residence on the grounds.</p>
<p>The steps to be taken are simple; chief among them is the removal
of all rubbish. Rock piles, trash piles, stacked lumber, tree
stumps and other forms of debris near or under houses often harbor
rats and mice which form the principal food of most snakes. In
addition, this trash furnishes cover for the reptiles and offers them
protection from enemies and bad weather. Therefore, if all rubbish
is removed from the premises, the food and shelter which attract
snakes are largely eliminated and the snakes are forced to seek a
more suitable environment. Dense, low growing plants may also
supply cover for snakes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>Finally, the removal of rubbish and dense vegetation enables the
homeowner to easily see and destroy poisonous snakes that may be
present. In settled areas, however, where poisonous snakes are particularly
abundant and present a serious problem, it may be necessary
to take further protective measures.</p>
<p>Dr. C. M. Bogert of the American Museum of Natural History
has suggested the use of a quarter-inch mesh wire fence to keep
snakes off residential property. This yard-high, snake-proof fence
is placed around the house in much the same manner as an ordinary
picket fence, except that the bottom must be set about six inches
into the ground to prevent snakes forcing their way beneath it. In
addition, all gates must be provided with close-fitting sills on the
bottoms and sides to insure a completely tight enclosure.</p>
<p>Experiments with fences of this kind were made to determine their
effectiveness and to seek possible improvements in their construction,
with the result that one important change was made. Copperheads
and small rattlesnakes could not get over the vertically-straight
fence, but a six-foot rattlesnake used in the experiment was able
to climb over it. When the same fence was tilted outward at a
30-degree angle, not even the largest snake was able to reach the
top. Although such fences are expensive and difficult to keep in
good repair, they may be desirable under some circumstances.</p>
<p>A less costly method of keeping snakes away from residential
property has been proposed by the manufacturers of a new chemical
that allegedly repels and kills snakes. The product, a granular
material with a civet musk odor, is reported by its distributors
to kill a snake less than two feet in length if it is exposed longer than
20 seconds. Preliminary tests made at the Houston Zoo indicate
that, in spite of claims to the contrary, the material had little
effect on the snakes used. Each of more than a dozen different
specimens, including examples of all the local poisonous kinds, unhesitatingly
crawled through a wide barrier of the repellent that
was poured on the ground. In some instances, the snake&rsquo;s tongue
contacted the granules, but none of the test reptiles showed any ill
effects from exposure to the chemical. While these crude tests are
certainly not conclusive, it would seem advisable to use commercial
repellents with some reservations until they can be proved effective.
Meanwhile, we can still prevent most snake bites by observing a
few simple safe practices.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">PROTECTION IN THE FIELD</span></h2>
<p>In the field, where poisonous snakes are more common, they
present a greater hazard to human life; consequently, campers,
crop farmers and others who spend a great deal of time outdoors
should necessarily take more care in avoiding snake bites. Because
almost all snake bites are inflicted on the arms or legs of the victim,
these limbs require special protection. The use of a little caution,
when placing hands or feet where snakes may be partially or completely
hidden from view, is the best protection you can give them.
This is particularly true when climbing hand-over-hand on rocky
ledges, where your hands reach the level of the ledge before your
eyes do. Rattlesnakes and copperheads are partial to such rocky
hillsides and here, especially during the warm days of early spring,
they prefer to coil and sun themselves.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p02.jpg" alt="Thoughtless reach" width="600" height="273" />
</div>
<p>Armadillo and pack rat burrows also make excellent shelters for
rattlesnakes, and only a reckless person would find an excuse to
reach into one of these holes. Yet one year, in South Texas alone,
at least two snake bites occurred when the victims, each in search
of small game, reached into armadillo holes and were bitten by
rattlesnakes coiled there.</p>
<p>Another way to invite snake bite is to thoughtlessly turn over a
log with bare hands or to step over one without first looking to
see whether a snake is coiled on the other side. Many snakes, particularly
the copperhead and coral snake, are fond of hiding beneath
or within decaying logs, as any snake collector will testify,
and such a log is at all times to be considered a potential snake
den. If a log must be moved, use a long stick as a pry-bar. Stepping
over a log will be less risky if boots or high-top shoes are worn, but
even then it is safer to see first what is on the other side.</p>
<p>Several types of footwear offer good protection against the bites
of most snakes. Especially effective are high-top leather shoes, riding
boots, rubber boots or a combination of army &ldquo;paratrooper shoes&rdquo;
and heavy leather puttees. Probably the best of these is a snakeproof
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
boot made of extra heavy bullhide leather, sold by the Gokey Company,
94 East 4th Street, St. Paul, Minnesota. For protection of the
legs above the knees, snakeproof pants that weigh little more than
ordinary duck trousers are available. They consist of three thicknesses
of duck material and one layer of fine wire mesh, flexible enough
to allow easy knee movement. Snakeproof leggings of similar material
can be purchased for safeguarding just the lower legs. Recently
marketed aluminum leggings furnish good protection in many cases,
but some brands tested were too thin and easily damaged; others
were too uncomfortable.</p>
<p>If a poisonous snake is discovered close by, the best protection
is to remain as still as possible until the snake has moved away.
It should be remembered that a snake is quick to strike at a moving
object, so to quickly step away at such a moment may be disastrous.
If a rattlesnake is heard nearby but cannot be located, do not begin
a wild dash for safety. Location of the snake may be misjudged
and by taking a step you are likely to walk into, rather than away
from, it. Again, remain still until the snake is sighted and, when it is
certain the snake is at least five or six feet away and no others are
nearby, slowly back away. If you must move away, do so as slowly
as possible.</p>
<p>Because our native poisonous snakes are mostly nocturnal in their
activities, remaining hidden during the day and emerging at night
in search of food, a flashlight should be used by persons who find
it necessary to travel through snake country after dark. During the
cool days of spring and autumn, however, nocturnal habits are often
reversed. During the day snakes search for warm spots in which to
sun themselves; by nightfall they are again under cover.</p>
<p>None of our poisonous Texas snakes ordinarily can strike more
than three-quarters of its body length, unless it has a firm backing
or is striking downward from an incline. Certainly none has the
ability to jump at an enemy, a feat often attributed to the rattlesnake.
A snake on the defensive is coiled with the forward part of
its body in a loose S position. When striking, this coil is straightened
out and the head is thrust forward. It is not necessary for a snake
to strike from a coil in order to bite. If picked up near the head,
it may simply turn, open its mouth and bite the hand.</p>
<p>It is dangerous to believe, as many do, that a water moccasin
cannot bite under water, and woe to the person who dares to seize
a submerged cottonmouth.</p>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">RECOGNIZING THE POISONOUS KINDS</span></h2>
<p>Suppose, in spite of attention to the precautions and protective
measures just outlined, someone is bitten by an unidentified snake.
Certainly the victim would not wish to delay treatment if the snake
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
were poisonous, because every minute wasted would make recovery
more difficult. On the other hand, he would not care to undergo
either the pain associated with snake bite treatment or the anxiety
following a bite if a harmless snake were the cause of the accident.
Yet time and again people have been bitten by harmless snakes and
have been needlessly given first aid and hospital treatment because
the offending snake was incorrectly classified as poisonous. Still
others have been bitten by harmless snakes and died from nothing
more than fright.</p>
<p>When recognition of the snake is doubtful, it should, if possible,
be killed and taken to a hospital or doctor&rsquo;s office for correct identification.
Always keep in mind, however, that a recently killed
poisonous snake may still be potentially dangerous. Even after its
head is cut from the body, a reptile is capable of marked reflex
activity; merely touching the head may cause it to bite. To be on
the safe side, use a stick to lift or carry a dead snake.</p>
<p>It is evident that the ability to distinguish between harmless and
poisonous snakes goes hand in hand with a knowledge of proper
first aid treatment. Ability to recognize a poisonous snake on sight
can best be achieved by a study of live poisonous kinds and a comparison
of them with harmless species. At many zoos, where both
kinds are on display in glass-fronted cages, they may be examined
safely. If a zoo is not conveniently near, an examination of photographs
showing the different kinds is probably the next best way to
become familiar with them.</p>
<p>It is generally considered by the layman that four kinds of poisonous
snakes are found in the United States&mdash;the rattlesnake, cottonmouth,
copperhead and coral snake. This grouping, although somewhat
arbitrary and certainly not zoologically correct, is firmly established
in the minds of most people and may very well be here to
stay. Nevertheless, a more accurate and scientific approach is possible
if we consider each species and subspecies as a different kind.</p>
<p>Illustrations in this booklet show the 16 kinds (species and subspecies)
of poisonous snakes known in Texas. These photographs,
together with descriptions in the text, should aid in identification.
The accompanying distribution map for each form has been compiled
from county records based on museum specimens, but in a
few cases reliable &ldquo;sight&rdquo; records have been used as proof of a
snake&rsquo;s occurrence within a county.</p>
<p>Distribution of snakes within Texas is incompletely known because
of a lack of reliable records; for this reason, the distribution maps
are necessarily far from complete. It is hoped, however, that the
lists will be brought up to date as new localities come to light. If
the reader can make any additions to the present lists, he is asked
to communicate with the author or to deliver specimens to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
nearest large college, zoo or museum maintaining a zoological
collection.</p>
<p>Only 16 of the approximately 106 different kinds of snakes found
in the state are dangerously poisonous to man, and some are so
rare that they are seldom seen. In addition, we have in Texas
several species of smaller snakes known as opisthoglyphs, each possessing
a mild venom and a set of small grooved fangs far back in
the upper jaw. Because of their weak and limited supply of venom
and small fangs, which are poorly adapted for injecting poison into
large animals, these rear-fanged snakes are considered harmless to
man. By far, the majority of species are small, being not more than
15 inches long and about three-sixteenths of an inch thick. In this
group are the blackheaded snakes (genus <i>Tantilla</i>) found over most
of the state. The slightly larger spotted night snakes (genus <i>Hypsiglena</i>)
of west and central Texas have enlarged but ungrooved teeth
in the upper jaw. Two Mexican rear-fanged snakes, found as far
north as the Brownsville region, are somewhat larger. They are the
blackstriped snake (<i>Coniophanes imperialis imperialis</i>) which grows
to about 20 inches in length, and the Texas cat-eye snake (<i>Leptodeira
annulata septentrionalis</i>), which reaches a length of about three feet.
Still another species, the very rare Texas lyre snake (<i>Trimorphodon
vilkinsonii</i>), is known from extreme western Texas. It is generally
less than three feet long.</p>
<p>In spite of the small percentage of poisonous kinds of snakes in
the state, it must be made clear that no one general rule can be used
safely to identify all of them at a glance. It is a mistaken idea that
all venomous snakes have broad, triangular heads. On the contrary,
by using this rule, many of our harmless snakes look more dangerous
than do some poisonous kinds. Furthermore, this generalization
is made useless by several exceptions, a notable example being the
coral snake which has a round head and does not look at all
poisonous.</p>
<p>Even the characteristic rattle is not always present to make a
rattlesnake&rsquo;s identification certain. Sometimes the snake&rsquo;s rattle is
accidentally broken off, in which case this identifying appendage is
gone. Then, too, a rattlesnake often is coiled in such a way that its
rattles are concealed beneath a loop of its body. Again, the tell-tale
rattle is not visible and it is necessary to recognize the snake by
some other means.</p>
<p>Disregard all so-called &ldquo;easy&rdquo; rules by which poisonous snakes
may be identified; instead, learn to know each one by its general
overall appearance. For example, to identify the cottonmouth, look
for a combination of its most characteristic features&mdash;relatively short,
stout body and a broad, flat head. Also look for a body color of
black, dark brown or olive and from 10 to 15 wide, usually indistinct,
crossbands which are generally lighter in the center than
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
on the edges. The upper jaw below the eye, as well as the lower
jaw, will be light colored in contrast to the dark color above the eye.
Together, these characteristics will make identification quite certain
at a reasonable distance. Remember that the young of this
snake are colored differently from the adults and you will not be
able to identify the juvenile by using the color characteristics of
the adult snake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">THE PIT VIPERS</span></h2>
<p>Our poisonous Texas snakes belong to two families&mdash;the <i>Viperidae</i>
(subfamily <i>Crotalinae</i>&mdash;pit vipers) and the <i>Elapidae</i> (cobra-like
snakes). The pit vipers, which include rattlesnakes, copperheads and
cottonmouths, possess an opening on either side of the head, between
the eye and the nostril. With these heat-sensitive pits, the snake can
locate warm-blooded prey in the dark and make a direct hit upon a
rat or mouse which it cannot see.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="Snake skeletons" width="600" height="209" />
</div>
<p>Snakes belonging to this family are further characterized by the
possession of elliptical eye pupils, somewhat triangular-shaped heads
and long, movable fangs in the front of the upper jaw. Each fang
is connected by a tube to the poison gland located just behind the
eye. When the snake is at rest and its mouth is closed, the fangs
lie folded back against the roof of the mouth. During the strike, the
mouth is opened so that the upper and lower jaws form an angle
of nearly 180 degrees. The fangs are then erected to point almost
directly forward. With the fangs in this position, the strike results
in a stabbing action rather than a true bite.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">THE COPPERHEADS</span></h2>
<p>Four kinds of copperheads are known in Texas. They are much
smaller and more slender than the closely related cottonmouth and,
because they have proportionately smaller fangs and less venom,
are not very dangerous to man. The four copperheads resemble one
another by having the same general pattern of chestnut or reddish-brown
crossbands on a lighter body color. Differences are based
mostly on the size and shape of crossbands and in the degree of
marking present on the belly.</p>
<p>Copperheads are most common in rocky areas of hilly or mountainous
country, as well as in wooded bottomlands. They are rarely
seen in dry, cactus country. Although spending most of their time
on the ground, copperheads occasionally climb bushes and low trees
in search of food. Along the Colorado River near Wharton, they
were observed high in trees; some were 40 feet above the ground.
The snakes reached these unusual heights by crawling along wild
grape vines that clung to the tree trunks and draped over lower
limbs. One snake hunter in the area collected nearly 100 copperheads
by pulling them off the branches.</p>
<p>Copperheads do most of their feeding at night. During the spring
in some parts of the state, they are found in large numbers along
streams and other moist areas, where they spend most of the day
hidden beneath decaying logs and other debris which affords good
cover. Copperheads also can be expected when air temperatures are
high, and when the soil and vegetation are wet from recent rain.
They often make their homes within the suburbs of large cities
where, due to their nocturnal habits and protective coloration, they
are apt to be overlooked.</p>
<p>Not quick to seek cover when approached, copperheads prefer to
lie perfectly still until an intruder has passed. Once molested, they
frequently vibrate their tails and, if among dry leaves, produce a
buzzing sound not unlike that made by a rattlesnake. Copperheads
are quick to strike at any annoying object, and often bite several
times in rapid succession.</p>
<p>Copperheads seldom deliver a fatal bite because of their short
fangs and small size. Their strike is often blocked by a mere trouser
leg. Records of the Antivenin Institute of America show that during
a 10-year period, not a single death resulted from 308 recorded
copperhead bites regardless of the lack or kind of treatment given
victims. In spite of these reassuring figures, it must be remembered
that the copperhead is potentially a dangerous snake, especially
when the bite involves a child. All bites from this species should
receive the same urgent consideration given the bite of a diamondback
rattlesnake.</p>
<p>The four forms of copperheads occurring in Texas are the only
kinds found in the United States.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<h3 id="c7">SOUTHERN COPPERHEAD
<br /><i>Agkistrodon contortrix contortrix</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="SOUTHERN COPPERHEAD" width="794" height="500" />
</div>
<p>Description&mdash;Lighter in color than the other copperheads, this
form has a body color of light brown or tan, often with a pinkish
tinge. Hourglass-shaped crossbands of darker brown are very narrow
along the middle of the back and are sometimes broken, forming
two separate triangular markings, one on each side of the body. As
on the northern copperhead, the bands are rounded at their bases.
The belly is pale and indistinctly marked.</p>
<p>Size&mdash;Adults average between 20 and 30 inches long, while some
especially large examples reach a length of more than 40 inches.</p>
<p>Young&mdash;The average number in a brood is five or six. As with all
North American pit vipers, the young do not hatch from eggs but
are born alive, enclosed in a thin membranous sack. They are paler
than adults, with a more vivid pattern, and a bright sulphur yellow
tail tip.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Distribution in Texas&mdash;The southern copperhead is known in
about the eastern third of the state, where it has been found in the
following counties: Austin, Bastrop, Bowie, Brazoria, Brazos, Burleson,
Calhoun, Chambers, Cherokee, Colorado, Fort Bend, Gonzales,
Grimes, Hardin, Harris, Harrison, Henderson, Hopkins, Houston,
Jefferson, Leon, Liberty, Madison, Matagorda, Montgomery, Nacogdoches,

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="NORTHERN COPPERHEAD" width="807" height="500" />
</div>
<p>Description&mdash;This darker form has a pattern of reddish-brown or
chestnut colored crossbands, which become narrower near the middle
of the back and rounded at the bases. The darker color of these
&ldquo;dumbbell&rdquo; shaped bands contrasts with the hazel-brown body color.
The underside of the snake is dark and indistinctly mottled with
gray or black. Its head is usually of a lighter tint than the body.</p>
<p>Size&mdash;Adults usually are about two and a half feet long but record
size individuals of more than 40 inches have been caught.</p>
<p>Young&mdash;Newborn northern copperheads, from three to 14 in a
brood, may be from eight to 10 inches long.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>Distribution&mdash;Records of this snake are rather widely scattered
over the northeastern part of the state. Specimens have been collected
in the following counties: Bastrop, Bowie, Burleson, Cass,
Collin, Colorado, Coryell, Dallas, Ellis, Fannin, Grayson, Guadalupe,
Hopkins, Hunt, Kaufman, Lamar, Lee, McLennan, Milam, Morris,
Robertson, Smith, Somervell, and Titus.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p06.jpg" alt="BROADBANDED COPPERHEAD" width="795" height="500" />
</div>
<p>Description&mdash;The very broad, straight edged crossbands of this
snake easily distinguish it from other copperheads. The similar
Trans-Pecos copperhead differs by the presence of a light colored
inverted U at the base of each crossband. The dark brown bands
of this form are slightly narrower at the middle of the back than on
the sides; their nearly straight edges gives the bands a squarish appearance.
The dark crossbands contrast strongly with the lighter
body color, while the belly is of almost the same shade as the
bands. The tail is tipped with yellowish green, more pronounced in
the young.</p>
<p>Size&mdash;Snakes of this subspecies probably reach a length of three
feet but most adults are about two feet long.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>Young&mdash;Litters probably average five or six but little else is known
about the breeding habits of this form.</p>
<p>Distribution&mdash;Widely scattered records include the following counties:
Atascosa, Bandera, Bastrop, Bexar, Bosque, Burnet, Callahan,
Comal, Cooke, Crockett, Denton, Dimmit, Eastland, Fayette, Frio,

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p07.jpg" alt="TRANS-PECOS COPPERHEAD" width="804" height="500" />
</div>
<p>Description&mdash;This species resembles the broadbanded copperhead
by its straight edged, squarish crossbands but differs from all other
copperheads by having uniformly dark or strongly mottled belly.
It also differs from the broadbanded form by the presence of a light
colored inverted U at the base of each crossband. The pattern
consists of about 13 chestnut-brown crossbands with narrow, dark
borders. The color between the bands is light hazel brown, flecked
with darker brown.</p>
<p>Size&mdash;This is the smallest of the copperheads, probably not reaching
a length of two and one-half feet.</p>
<p>Young&mdash;Nothing is known of the breeding habits of this rare snake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>Distribution&mdash;This form apparently is restricted to the mountains
of West Texas, where it is known in Brewster, Jeff Davis, Presidio
and Terrell Counties. Until 1949 it was found sparingly throughout
its range and less than a dozen specimens had been found by experienced
collectors. Recently, however, students from The University
of Texas obtained about 100 of these snakes during a six weeks&rsquo;
summer course in a small section of Terrell County. This indicates
that the Trans-Pecos copperhead is common, but in restricted areas
only. Such areas generally are in wooded canyons and live oak
groves where there is some leaf litter.</p>

<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">THE COTTONMOUTH</span></h2>
<p>Only one kind of cottonmouth is found in Texas. It is one of our
heaviest and largest poisonous snakes and may reach a length of
more than five feet. When viewed from above, the head appears
triangular shaped and from the side the head looks flat on top.</p>
<p>The eye pupils, as with all members of the pit viper sub-family, are
elliptical.</p>
<h3 id="c12">WESTERN COTTONMOUTH
<br /><i>Agkistrodon piscivorus leucostoma</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p08.jpg" alt="WESTERN COTTONMOUTH" width="797" height="500" />
</div>
<p>Description&mdash;This is the most variable poisonous snake in the
state, both in color and in the presence or absence of markings.
Adults are much less brilliantly marked than are the young or
newborn snakes. Adults have a background of dark brown and are
marked by from 10 to 15 dark, wide crossbands somewhat lighter
in the center than at the edges. The bands, which have irregular
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
edges, become a little wider along the sides. However, not all cottonmouths
look like this. While some individuals have clearly defined
crossbands, others have none. There is also considerable variation
in color. Some cottonmouths are brown; some are olive brown or
olive green; and some are entirely black. The lower jaw, as well as
the upper jaw below the eye, is light in contrast to the dark color
on top of the head. Young cottonmouths are vividly marked on a
background of reddish-brown, highlighted by darker brown bands
edged with white. They look much like copperheads.</p>
<p>Size&mdash;In Texas, this heavy-bodied snake reaches a maximum
length of about four and a half or five feet, but the average is
more nearly three feet.</p>
<p>Young&mdash;About eight are born in each litter. They are from six
to eight inches long at birth.</p>
<div class="img">

<p>The cottonmouth is one of our largest poisonous snakes. It is
particularly abundant in the coastal marshes of southeastern Texas
where it is found along streams, ponds and lakes. Although ordinarily
rather sluggish, it immediately draws back its head and opens its
mouth widely in a threatening manner when annoyed, exposing the
white tissue lining the inside of the mouth. This characteristic
pose is responsible for its popular name. Moreover, like the copperhead,
which also lacks rattles, it has the habit of vibrating its tail
when sufficiently annoyed. Thus, when it is among dry leaves, or
if the tail strikes a hard object, the resulting sound may be similar
to that made by a rattlesnake.</p>
<p>The name water moccasin, which is loosely applied to any and all
water snakes as well as to the cottonmouth, has resulted in a popular
but misplaced belief that all &ldquo;water&rdquo; snakes are poisonous. It should
be pointed out here that the cottonmouth, <i>Agkistrodon piscivorus
leucostoma</i>, is our only poisonous aquatic serpent. The several
kinds of harmless water snakes, which in some instances resemble it,
are devoid of poison. They can, at most, inflict a bite no more serious
than the scratch of a cat and these wounds require only the first aid
recommended for minor cuts.</p>
<p>Harmless water snakes most frequently mistaken for the cottonmouth
include the large diamondbacked water snake of central
and eastern Texas, the blotched water snake found over most of
the state, and the yellowbellied and broadbanded water snakes of
eastern Texas. Most of them are relatively heavy bodied, possess
somewhat diamond shaped heads and, although not venomous, will
bite viciously if stepped upon or handled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">THE RATTLESNAKES</span></h2>
<p>More than one-half of all the poisonous kinds of snakes known in
Texas are rattlesnakes, and records show that almost every county
has at least one variety. Texas rattlesnakes range in size from the
very small, 18-inch western pigmy rattlesnake, which rarely if
ever causes death among humans, to the seven-foot western diamondback
rattlesnake, known to be one of the most dangerous snakes in
North America. All have comparatively stout bodies, facial pits
characteristic of the family, and rattles.</p>
<p>The rattle, which sets this snake apart, is a series of loosely interlocking
horny segments which, when vibrated, produce a sharp
buzzing sound as the segments strike against one another. A rattlesnake&rsquo;s
age cannot be determined by the number of segments of
its rattle because a new segment is added with each shedding of the
skin. Because a snake may shed several times a year, the resulting
number of segments added annually may be six or more. On the
other hand, the segments are frequently broken off as the rattle
becomes caught in underbrush, so that few rattlesnakes have a
complete rattle.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p09.jpg" alt="WESTERN MASSASAUGA" width="797" height="500" />
</div>
<p>Description&mdash;The general body color is brown or gray. About 39
dark brown, oval blotches extend along the middle of the back
while two rows of smaller blotches are found along each side. These
blotches are narrowly edged with a lighter color.</p>
<p>Size&mdash;Adults average two feet in length; larger specimens are
sometimes as long as three feet.</p>
<p>Young&mdash;The young resemble the adults but are lighter in color.
Average number in a litter is eight or nine and they measure eight
or nine inches at birth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>Distribution&mdash;Records of this snake are widely scattered throughout
the state, including the following counties: Andrews, Aransas,
Armstrong, Bell, Bosque, Brazos, Calhoun, Cameron, Chambers, Clay,
Colorado, Crosby, Dickens, El Paso, Gaines, Galveston, Hardeman,
Haskell, Hemphill, Jim Hogg, Johnson, King, Matagorda, McLennan,
Midland, Nolan, Nueces, Parker, Pecos, Roberts, Shackelford,
Sutton, Tarrant, Throckmorton, Victoria, Wheeler, Wilbarger, Winkler,
Yoakum, and Young.</p>
<p>This small rattlesnake is uncommon in Texas, although years ago
it was plentiful in some parts of the state. J. K. Strecker in his
<i>Reptiles and Amphibians of Texas</i>, 1915, states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Luttrell of Claude, Armstrong County, informed me
that he has often killed from 50 to 60 during one wheat
season, but during the past four or five years he has not seen
more than half a dozen a year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wet places, usually near swamps or marshes, are its favorite
habitat. One of our most docile rattlesnakes, it is seldom inclined
to use its rattle, even when almost stepped upon.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p10.jpg" alt="WESTERN PIGMY RATTLESNAKE" width="788" height="500" />
</div>
<p>Description&mdash;The body color of this snake is from gray to grayish-brown.
Its back is marked with about 35 small, dark spots which are
wider than long. Another row of smaller spots is located along each
side toward the belly.</p>
<p>Size&mdash;Specimens average 18 inches long and large examples may
reach a length of more than two feet.</p>
<p>Young&mdash;The normal brood contains from eight to 10 but some
may have as many as 18. Average length of the newborn is five or
six inches.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>Distribution&mdash;All county records of this snake, except one from
Mitchell County, are in the eastern part of the state. The Mitchell
County record may be an error. Records include the following counties:
Anderson, Angelina, Brazoria, Brazos, Chambers, Cooke, Dallas,
Galveston, Hardin, Harris, Harrison, Henderson, Houston, Jasper,
Jefferson, Lamar, Leon, Liberty, Matagorda, McLennan, Mitchell,
Montgomery, Newton, Orange, Red River, Refugio, Robertson, San
Jacinto, Smith, Somervell, Victoria, Walker, Wharton, and Wise.</p>
<p>The western pigmy rattlesnake prefers to live in dry areas; reports
of professional collectors indicate that it is found in greatest number
after heavy rains and at night. While more aggressive than its close
relative, the massasauga, its small size makes it one of our least
dangerous poisonous snakes. Its rattle is small, often difficult to see,
and cannot be heard at distances greater than a few feet.</p>

<img src="images/p11.jpg" alt="WESTERN DIAMONDBACK RATTLESNAKE" width="799" height="500" />
</div>
<p>Description&mdash;Although individuals of this species show a great deal
of variation in color, from a chalky white to a dull red, they can
be identified immediately by the alternate black and white rings
of about equal width on the tail. There is a pattern of brown
diamond shaped markings along the middle of the back, which
stands out against the lighter body color. Each diamond has a
narrow light border.</p>
<p>Size&mdash;Adults are generally from three and a half to four and a
half feet long. Reliable reports indicate that this species grows to
a length of over seven and a half feet, and six-foot specimens are
not rare.</p>
<p>Young&mdash;Broods average 10 or 12 but occasionally contain 20 or
more. The newborn diamondback is about a foot long and looks
very much like the adult.</p>

<p>This is the most dangerous and, at the same time, the most common
poisonous snake in the state. Therefore, it is one which all
Texas outdoorsmen should be able to recognize on sight. A summary
of snake bite cases in the United States over a 10-year period
shows that more people died from bites of this species than from
bites of any other North American snake. There are several reasons
why this snake is responsible for so many bites and such a high
number of deaths. Chief among these is its large size. It ranks as one
of the two largest poisonous snakes in the country, being second
only to the eight-foot eastern diamondback rattlesnake of the southeastern
states. In direct proportion to its size, it has long fangs and
poison glands which hold a great amount of venom. These factors
insure a long strike and deep fang penetration. In addition, it has
an unusually furious disposition and, if threatened with danger or
sufficiently annoyed, will vigorously defend itself instead of seeking
immediate escape.</p>
<p>Although strictly a land snake, the diamondback may sometimes
be found crossing streams or ponds and, occasionally, individuals
will venture out into lakes and bays.</p>

<h3 id="c17">TIMBER RATTLESNAKE
<br /><i>Crotalus horridus horridus</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p13.jpg" alt="TIMBER RATTLESNAKE" width="736" height="500" />
</div>
<p>Description&mdash;This snake is much like the larger canebrake rattler
but lacks the dark stripe from the eye to the back of the mouth,
and generally is without the reddish-brown stripe down the middle
of its back. Dark brown chevron shaped crossbands contrast with
the general body color of yellowish tan. In some specimens black
stippling occurs between the markings. Both black and light color
phases of this snake are found in some parts of its range. It is
unknown whether the dark specimens occur in Texas. The tail is
marked with three or four dark bands on the lighter specimens but
is altogether black on the darker ones.</p>
<p>Size&mdash;Throughout its range this snake has an average length of
from three and a half to four feet, but a specimen six feet long is on
record.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>Young&mdash;The number in a brood varies from three to 12. Length
of the newborn is eight or nine inches.</p>
<p>Distribution&mdash;The timber rattlesnake prefers rocky hills and mountains
that are not too heavily wooded, but it sometimes inhabits
bogs and swamps at lower elevations. In either situation, it seldom
survives for long in areas heavily populated by man. In common with
most other rattlesnakes, it seeks escape when approached by man and
fights only when surprised or cornered. Known in northeastern Texas,
it is reported from Cooke, Denton, Eastland, Grayson, Lamar, Red
River, Taylor, and Wise Counties.</p>
<p>Like the prairie rattler, it often seeks the same denning areas
year after year and congregates in numbers to hibernate for the
winter.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p14.jpg" alt="CANEBRAKE RATTLESNAKE" width="791" height="500" />
</div>
<p>Description&mdash;This is a large and heavily built snake with a brown
or tan back marked by a series of wide, dark, chevron shaped crossbands.
It may be distinguished from the similar timber rattlesnake
by its larger size, its more vivid markings, and the presence of a
dark stripe from the eye to the angle of its mouth. Generally, a narrow,
reddish-brown stripe extends down the middle of the back. Its
tail, as in some other rattlesnakes, is entirely black.</p>
<p>Size&mdash;In Texas this snake reaches a length of about six feet, while
in nearby Louisiana exceptionally large specimens, some nearly seven
feet long, have been found. Length averages four and a half feet.</p>
<p>Young&mdash;About eight or ten are born in a brood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Distribution&mdash;This species prefers wooded areas in wet bottomlands.
It has been found in the following counties: Austin, Bexar,
Bosque, Bowie, Brazoria, Brazos, Cass, Cooke, Coryell, Dallas, Denton,
Eastland, Ellis, Falls, Fayette, Freestone, Gonzales, Grayson,
Hardin, Harris, Henderson, Jasper, Jefferson, Liberty, Madison, McLennan,

<br /><i>Crotalus lepidus lepidus</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p15.jpg" alt="BANDED ROCK RATTLESNAKE" width="796" height="500" />
</div>
<p>Description&mdash;This snake is very similar to the mottled rock rattlesnake,
with which it might be confused, but from which it differs by
having a more mottled appearance between the crossbands and a dark
stripe from the eye to the angle of the mouth. It has a pattern of
about 18 or 20 widely spaced dark crossbands with irregular edges in
contrast to its gray body color. Belly color varies from cream to pink.</p>
<p>In the Chisos Mountains, where there is much reddish igneous
rock, the normal color of this snake is pinkish; the variety has been
given the name of &ldquo;pink rattler&rdquo; by people of that region. Specimens
from the limestone ledges along the Pecos Canyon at Howard Creek
and Sheffield are very light in color, resembling the limestone rock
on which they are found.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Size&mdash;This is one of our smallest rattlesnakes, having an average
length of two feet. The rattle is rather large in proportion to the
small size of the snake.</p>
<p>Young&mdash;About four are born in a brood and they measure about
seven and a half inches at birth.</p>
<p>Distribution&mdash;This form is restricted to the mountainous areas of
the western and southwestern parts of the state; it has been found
in the following counties: Brewster, Culberson, Edwards, Jeff Davis,
Maverick, Pecos, Presidio, Real, Terrell, and Val Verde.</p>
<p>Because of its small size and distribution restricted to rocky places
at high elevations, the banded rock rattlesnake cannot be considered
a serious menace to man. Apparently there is no record of anyone
ever having been bitten by this snake. It has a quiet disposition
and, if alarmed, will immediately retreat within the masses of jumbled
rock which are its home.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p16.jpg" alt="MOTTLED ROCK RATTLESNAKE" width="798" height="500" />
</div>
<p>Description&mdash;This species and the banded rock rattlesnake look
much alike. Both are small and slender, and marked with a series
of widely-spaced dark crossbands along the length of the body and
tail. The banded rock rattlesnake, however, has about 20 or 22 dark
brown or black crossbands, which contrast strongly with its greenish-gray
body color. It further differs from the banded rock rattlesnake
in lacking a dark stripe from the eye to the angle of its mouth.</p>
<p>Size&mdash;Adults average two feet in length.</p>
<p>Young&mdash;A record of one brood is the only known published information
concerning the young of this snake. Carl F. Kauffeld of
the Staten Island Zoo mentioned a litter of four and wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All were irritable from the first, promptly broke through
the membranous sacs in which they were enclosed and struck
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
violently at any passing object. All were marked and colored
much like the adults except that the delicate pink along
the venter of the latter was not in evidence; and the tails,
which in the adults are salmon or terra cotta red (including
the basal segment of the rattle) were brilliantly sulphur
yellow for at least their distal half....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The newborn snakes measured about eight inches in length.</p>
<p>Distribution&mdash;This subspecies is found in much the same type
of country as the banded rock rattlesnake, being partial to rock slides
high in the mountains. The two counties in the state in which it is
known, El Paso and Culberson, are both in extreme western Texas.
In disposition it is said to be quite timid; however, at times, it
becomes irritable without much provocation.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p17.jpg" alt="BLACKTAILED RATTLESNAKE" width="794" height="500" />
</div>
<p>Description&mdash;There are about 32 dark rhomboid markings along
the back. These light edged blotches are centered with one or two
irregular light areas, while the outer edges form bars which extend
down each side to the belly. Body color varies from gray to olive
green, while the blotches are dark brown or black. The tail is uniformly
black, as its name implies.</p>
<p>Size&mdash;The blacktailed rattlesnake is one of our largest poisonous
snakes. Texas specimens average three and a half feet but may grow
somewhat longer. One, nearly 50 inches long, was collected at Persimmon
Gap in Brewster County.</p>
<p>Young&mdash;About five young comprise the average brood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>Distribution&mdash;Records are available from the following counties:
Bandera, Bexar, Brewster, Burnet, Comal, Culberson, Edwards, El

Presidio, Real, San Saba, Terrell, Travis, Upton, and Val Verde.</p>
<p>Hilly areas with steep canyons are the preferred habitat of this
snake. In the Big Bend region of Texas, where apparently it is the
most common rattlesnake, specimens have been taken from as high
as 7,400 feet elevation. It shows an inclination to coil in bushes or
on tree limbs near the ground, although by far the majority of
specimens encountered are found on rocky ledges. Its disposition
has been reported by some to be very irritable, while others claim
it is quiet and docile.</p>

<p>Description&mdash;This moderately slender snake is very similar in color
and markings to the western diamondback rattlesnake. Its body is
olive green with a pattern of darker diamond shaped markings down
the middle of the back. These blotches are well defined by a border
of light scales. It differs from the western diamondback in having
narrower black tail rings and wider white spaces between these rings.
A narrow light line extends from the eye to above the angle of the
mouth.</p>
<p>Size&mdash;Average length is three feet, or shorter than the diamondback
rattlesnake. Because of its more slender form, it does not
appear as large as a western diamondback of equal length.</p>
<p>Young&mdash;The average litter contains eight, the young being similar
to the adults in color and marking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Distribution&mdash;The Mojave rattlesnake is known in Brewster, Hudspeth

<p>Description&mdash;Color of the back is greenish or grayish. A series of
dark, rounded blotches extends down the middle of the back. These
markings, with narrow white borders, become wider and shorter
near the tail to form bands. In front of the eye is a narrow light line
which extends backward and downward to the mouth.</p>
<p>Size&mdash;Rather slender in form, this snake reaches a maximum size
of five and a half feet. Average length is three feet.</p>
<p>Young&mdash;Broods average 12 but vary from four to 21.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>

<h2 id="c24"><span class="small">THE ELAPID SNAKES</span></h2>
<p>The single representative of this family (<i>Elapidae</i>) in Texas is
small, slender, and brightly colored with rings of red, yellow and
black. The head is small and rounded and eye pupils are circular.
Its venom-conducting fangs, in the front of the upper jaw, are small
and permanently erect; consequently, some chewing is required
before the snake can inject its poison with certainty. As if to make
up for its poor biting equipment, the coral snake possesses a venom
of high toxicity, a venom much more potent than that of the pit
vipers which are so well adapted for injecting their poison quickly
and deeply. Because this poison produces scarcely any severe local
symptoms, the danger from a bite may be overlooked and treatment
delayed. Although pain is present, the usual dramatic symptoms of
snake poisoning, such as extensive discoloration and great swelling
at the site of bite, are scarcely noticeable. This absence of conclusive
symptoms may lead the victim to believe he has been bitten by a
harmless snake. In all coral snake bites, prompt action is necessary.</p>
<h3 id="c25">TEXAS CORAL SNAKE
<br /><i>Micrurus fulvius tenere</i></h3>
<div class="img" id="fig1">
<img src="images/p20.jpg" alt="" width="790" height="500" />
<p class="pcap">Left, coral snake; right, Mexican milk snake</p>
</div>
<p>Description&mdash;Generally less than two and a half feet long, this
is our most colorful venomous snake and, at the same time, the least
dangerous in appearance. Its small, narrow head, slender body and
brightly colored pattern can be dangerously misleading. Children,
especially, are inclined to pick it up because they are attracted by its
colors and convinced that such beauty must be harmless. The pattern
consists of red, yellow and black rings which encircle the body in
the following order: a broad black ring, a much narrower yellow
ring, a broad red ring, a narrow yellow ring, a broad black ring,
and so on. Note that the red and yellow rings on the body touch
one another. The snout is black and a broad yellow ring crosses the
back of the head.</p>
<p>Identification of this snake would be simple were it not for the
fact that several harmless snakes resemble it in form and coloration.
These mimics are marked with yellow, red and black rings&mdash;but the
arrangement is consistently different from that of the coral snake.
The red and yellow rings of the coral snake touch one another,
while in the harmless forms these colors are separated by black rings.
A simple rhyme adopted by Boy Scouts to help them associate &ldquo;danger&rdquo;
with the color combination found on the coral snake is, &ldquo;Red
and yellow kill a fellow.&rdquo; Remember this easy rhyme and, when
you find yourself involved with a colorful little snake with adjacent
red and yellow rings, be cautious.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>The harmless kind most closely resembling the coral snake probably
is the Mexican milk snake, technically known as <i>Lampropeltis
doliata annulata</i> and found south of Kerrville. The head of this
snake normally is black. Body and tail are marked with a series of
from 19 to 25 narrow yellow rings bordered by slightly wider black
rings. The red rings on the body are just as wide as the combined
yellow and two adjacent black rings. Another of these mimics is the
western milk snake (<i>Lampropeltis doliata gentilis</i>), a small species
usually less than two feet long, which is native to central and western
Texas. It has a pattern of from 25 to 40 yellow rings which are bordered
by black. The red rings are separated from the yellow by
black rings. All rings on this form are very narrow. In the southeastern
part of the state is found still another of these mimics&mdash;the
Louisiana milk snake (<i>Lampropeltis doliata amaura</i>). Rarely reaching
a length of two feet, this form has a pattern of narrow yellow
rings which are bordered on each side by narrow black rings. The
much wider red rings are separated from the yellow by the black
rings. In the scarlet snake (<i>Cemophora coccinea</i>) of eastern and
coastal Texas, the pattern is a series of wide red blotches bordered
by much narrower black bands. The yellow bands, about half the
width of the red ones, are separated from them by the black bands.
The belly is unmarked white or yellow. Adults are about a foot and
a half long but a 25-inch specimen is on record.</p>
<p>Size&mdash;The coral snake is generally less than two and a half feet
long with a body diameter of about three-eights of an inch. The
largest known specimen is nearly 42 inches long and was collected
on the mid-Texas coast.</p>
<p>Young&mdash;This is the only poisonous Texas snake which lays eggs.
From two to nine eggs constitute the egg complement of this form.</p>
<p>Distribution&mdash;This snake is known in the following counties: Angelina,
Aransas, Atascosa, Austin, Bandera, Bastrop, Bee, Bell, Bexar,
Bosque, Brazoria, Brazos, Brooks, Burleson, Burnet, Caldwell, Calhoun,

San Jacinto, San Patricio, Sutton, Tarrant, Terrell, Tom Green,
Travis, Victoria, Walker, Waller, Wharton, Willacy, Williamson, and

<p>Unlike most other poisonous snakes, this species is a burrower,
coming to the surface after a warm rain to feed upon small lizards
and snakes. Contrary to even expert opinion, it is not primarily
nocturnal, but becomes active during daylight and evening hours.
It is often found in or under decaying logs or other trash, especially
in damp regions; in the San Antonio area, specimens frequently are
found under flagstones near homes.</p>

<p>In spite of its inoffensive nature, the coral snake is no different
from other snakes in that it will bite if stepped upon or restrained.
It does not deliberately coil and strike with accuracy like the pit
vipers. Instead, it swings the forward part of the body from side to
side until it can secure a hold to bite and then begins a chewing
motion to imbed its short fangs.</p>
<p>The notion that its mouth is too small to bite effectively has in
some instances resulted in careless disregard for its deadliness. It
is true that the head appears very short and the mouth not capable
of opening widely. Actually, the skull is rather elongated and the
mouth can be opened to a greater degree than might be expected.
Even when it bites a relatively flat surface, such as the back of the
hand, the snake&rsquo;s closing mouth will pinch the skin, allowing the
fangs to penetrate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<h2 id="c26"><span class="small">VENOMS</span></h2>
<p>Generally speaking, snake venoms are divided into two broad categories,
neurotoxic and hemorrhagic, depending on their destructive
actions. Neurotoxic poison is characteristic of cobras and coral snakes
and produces considerable pain but little or no swelling and discoloration
at the bite. Death from this type of poison is the result
of respiratory failure and is preceded by such symptoms as headache,
muscular weakness, lethargy and facial paralysis with accompanying
difficulty in speech.</p>
<p>Hemorrhagic venom, on the other hand, affects primarily the blood
cells and vessels. Local reaction is evident soon after injection of the
venom and consists of pain, discoloration, and swelling at the site
of the bite. All of these symptoms gradually become more extensive.
Weakness, nausea, vomiting and&mdash;occasionally&mdash;diarrhea may follow
in a few hours. In many cases of snake bite, shock is present.</p>
<p>Although every snake&rsquo;s venom contains both the neurotoxic and
hemorrhagic elements, the proportion of these components varies
with each kind of poisonous snake. For example, the venom of the
coral snake is primarily neurotoxic in action, but produces a small
hemorrhagic effect as well. On the other hand, water moccasin venom,
although basically hemorrhagic in action, has a greater amount of
the neurotoxic element than do the poisons of the copperheads or
rattlesnakes. Furthermore, neurotoxic effects are more evident following
the bites of the Mojave and massasauga rattlers than they
are in poisonings by other Texas rattlesnakes.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig2">
<img src="images/p21.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="382" />
<p class="pcap">FIRST AID KIT</p>
</div>
<p>Equipment necessary for first aid treatment of snake bite includes
a sharp cutting instrument such as a razor blade or sharp knife for
making incisions, a constricting band to retard the flow of lymph,
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
iodine or alcohol for sterilizing the knife and bitten area, and a suction
device for removing the venom-contaminated lymph. This last
item is especially important if you are alone and cannot reach
the wound to apply suction by mouth.</p>
<p>Snake bite kits containing the essential items can be purchased at
most drug or sporting goods stores at a cost of from two to five
dollars, depending upon the make. Anyone who spends much time
outdoors should carry a snake bite kit at all times, and he should
know how to use it. A smaller kit can be more easily carried and is
less likely to be left at home or in the car.</p>
<h2 id="c27"><span class="small">DIAGNOSING THE BITE</span></h2>
<p>To make certain that a poisonous snake has caused the bite, first
examine the wound for teeth marks. In a perfect bite by a poisonous
snake (excluding the coral snake), the pattern will reveal two distinctly
larger holes where the fangs have entered the flesh. There
also may be two rows of smaller teeth marks between these punctures.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p21a.jpg" alt="Snakebite patterns" width="500" height="221" />
</div>
<p>Furthermore, if the snake engages the lower jaw, two additional
rows of small teeth impressions will be seen below the first group.</p>
<p>Frequently the bite pattern is not a clear one. For example, if
the snake pulls to one side as it disengages the fangs after a strike,
the result is a series of scratch marks instead of punctures. There
is also the possibility that the snake will engage only a single fang;
or, perhaps, during fang replacement, two fangs are temporarily in
position on one or both sides of the upper jaw. Any of these conditions,
as well as others, can contribute to an obscure bite pattern.</p>
<p>The bite of a coral snake often is difficult to diagnose by examination
of the wound. Because this snake impels its fangs in a sort
of chewing motion, the pattern created by its bite may be two
groups of closely spaced punctures where the fangs have entered
the flesh a number of different times.</p>
<p>A clearly defined harmless snake bite pattern consists of a series
of uniformly small punctures (four rows made by teeth in the upper
jaw, two rows by teeth in the lower), but always without the large
fang holes. More typically, a non-poisonous bite produces several
rows of scratches.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Pit-viper poisoning is diagnosed primarily by the presence of <i>local</i>
signs and symptoms. The most important of these are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. <i>Pain</i> accompanies most poisonous snake bites. Generally intense
and burning in character, it becomes more severe with the passing
of time. This symptom alone is not conclusive because pain
can be imagined following a non-poisonous bite. Occasionally
in a severe bite, the pain is replaced by numbness and tingling.</p>
<p>2. <i>Swelling</i> at the bite area is present in every case of poisoning.
It will appear within five to 30 minutes. In a severe case, the
swelling may continue to spread for 24 hours. There will be
no swelling from a bite by a non-poisonous snake or by a poisonous
snake that injected no venom.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p22.jpg" alt="Snakebite swelling" width="600" height="143" />
</div>
<p>3. <i>Discoloration</i>, reddish or bruise-like in appearance, begins
around the fang punctures within a half hour and becomes
gradually more extensive.</p>
<p>Intense local pain is symptomatic of coral snake poisoning
but, unlike a case of pit-viper poisoning, swelling and discoloration
are not pronounced. Diagnosis of coral snake envenomation
is difficult and must be based primarily on systemic symptoms:
headaches, weakness, lethargy and facial paralysis.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="c28"><span class="small">SEVERITY OF THE BITE</span></h2>
<p>Even after the bite has been diagnosed as venomous, it is not
immediately possible to predict the course it will follow. The severity
of each case of snake poisoning is determined by the speed
with which symptoms progress. Although the bite of a large snake is
generally more serious than one caused by a small snake, the seriousness
of a bite cannot be gauged by snake size alone. Some variable
factors that affect the severity of each case include:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>1. Age, size and health of the victim.</dt>
<dt>2. His allergy complex and sensitivity to protein poisoning.</dt>
<dt>3. His emotional condition immediately after having been bitten.</dt>
<dt>4. Location of bite on the victim.</dt>
<dt>5. Amount of fang penetration and venom injection.</dt>
<dt>6. Number of times the victim was bitten.</dt>
<dt>7. Kind and size of snake that bit him.</dt>
<dt>8. Whether or not the snake recently had eaten.</dt>
<dt>9. Conditions of the snake&rsquo;s fangs.</dt>
<dt>10. How soon treatment was administered.</dt></dl>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<h2 id="c29"><span class="small">FIRST AID TREATMENT</span></h2>
<p>It is important that every snake bite victim receive first aid
treatment as soon as possible. The patient must not exert himself by
running, because increased circulation brought on by such physical
activity will speed up absorption of the poison. For the same reason,
the use of whiskey or other stimulants should be avoided.</p>
<p>The victim&rsquo;s state of mind is important; he must promptly be
convinced that his chances for recovery are good&mdash;and, indeed, they
are. He should not be terrified by the thought that every snake bite
means certain death. Actually, a survey of case histories shows that
with prompt and proper treatment, only about one or two per cent
of all snake bites in this country are fatal.</p>
<p>There is a considerable difference of opinion about the correct
first aid treatment for poisonous snake bite. The Division of Medical
Sciences of the National Research Council, a section of the National
Academy of Sciences, recently made a study to determine the most
effective method of such treatment. It recommended immobilization
of the bitten limb, application of a constricting band, and prompt
incision and suction.</p>
<p>Based on these recommendations, the following first aid treatment
for poisonous snake bite is suggested:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. IMMOBILIZE THE AFFECTED ARM OR LEG whenever
possible. Where this is not practicable, keep movement of the
bitten limb to a minimum. Muscular activity helps increase
the spread of venom. Whenever feasible, transport the victim
by litter to further medical aid.</p>
<p>2. APPLY A CONSTRICTING BAND from two to four inches
above the bite, between the wound and the heart. This will
help to limit the spread of venom until it can be removed
by incision and suction or neutralized by antivenin. A piece of
rubber tubing or a strap tourniquet, included with every snake
bite kit, is best for this purpose. When these are not available,
items of clothing may be used. A shoe lace, neckerchief or a
strip of clothing torn from shirt or trousers will do. The poison,
unless injected directly into a major blood vessel or
deeply into a muscle, is absorbed slowly by the lymphatics
below the skin. Therefore, do not restrict the deeper blood
circulation by applying the constricting band too tightly. It
should be loose enough for a finger to be slipped under it with
little difficulty. Remember that during first aid treatment the
constricting band must be loosened every 15 minutes for about
two minutes. This precaution may prevent gangrene. If the
bite is on the hand or forearm, take off rings, bracelets or
other jewelry because subsequent swelling may make their removal
difficult.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p23.jpg" alt="Applying constricting band" width="524" height="528" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>3. MAKE INCISIONS after sterilizing the cutting instrument and
the bite area with iodine or alcohol. If no antiseptic is available,
the blade of the cutting instrument can be sterilized by
holding it over a flame (a match will do). Make <i>one</i> cut over
each fang mark parallel with the long axis of the bitten limb,
not across it. Incisions should be one-quarter inch long and one-eighth
to one-quarter inch deep, but definitely no longer than
the diameter of the suction apparatus being used. This would
allow air to enter the suction bulb from the outside and the
device would then be unable to work. Incisions are of the
utmost importance to first aid treatment; without them little
or no poison can be withdrawn from the wound by suction.
However, making even a small incision involves some risk and
this operation should be done with considerable care. Improper
or carelessly applied first aid may actually do more harm than
good. Although a physician may later decide to make additional
incisions to relieve the pressure of swelling, only the cuts over
the fang marks are recommended for first aid.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p23a.jpg" alt="Making incision" width="532" height="534" />
</div>
<p>4. APPLY SUCTION to the cuts. This can best be done with
one of the suction devices manufactured for that purpose but,
if none is available, suction can be applied by mouth. There
is little danger in oral suction unless the lips or inside of the
mouth have cuts or abrasions. Contrary to popular opinion,
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
a tooth cavity will not permit passage of venom into the blood.
Moreover, snake venom is destroyed by the stomach&rsquo;s digestive
juices, so if some is accidentally swallowed, there is little need
to worry if you have a healthy system. Only during the first
30 minutes following the bite can much venom be removed by
incision and suction.</p>
<div class="img">

</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p23d.jpg" alt="Snakebite kit" width="528" height="526" />
</div>
<p>5. GET TO MEDICAL AID as soon as possible&mdash;but keep in
mind that unnecessary physical exertion is harmful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Antivenom may be administered soon after first aid has been started,
but this is best left to a doctor. The North American Antisnakebite
Serum made by Wyeth, Inc., of Philadelphia 3, Pennsylvania, is
effective against pit viper bites but is of less value in the treatment
of coral snake poisoning. Because coral snakes cause so few bites
in the United States, no serum to neutralize their venom is prepared
in this country. In South America, where these snakes are common
and may reach a length of five feet, a serum to neutralize the poison is
being produced by the Instituto Butantan at Sao Paulo, Brazil. It
and other foreign snake bite serums often are available at larger zoos
where exotic poisonous species are exhibited.</p>
<h2 id="c30"><span class="small">SUGGESTIONS TO PHYSICIANS</span></h2>
<p>In most areas of Texas, snake bite is an uncommon medical emergency,
and one with which few doctors have had experience. For
this reason, the following recommendations by the National Research
Council&rsquo;s Division of Medical Sciences are included for the
benefit of the physician.</p>
<h4><i>Statement on Hospital Care Following Bites by Venomous Snakes</i>
<br /><i>December 14, 1960</i></h4>
<h5 id="c31"><i>Admission Procedures</i></h5>
<p>The routine admission history and physical examination should
provide and record, if possible, the identity and length of the snake,
the time of the bite, and the details of all first aid measures employed,
including the time lapse for each and the mode of transportation
to the hospital. The record should state whether a tourniquet,
incision and suction, or the ligature-cryotherapy technique
has or has not been used. Inquiry should be made concerning previous
bites, allergic manifestations in general, and whether or not the
patient had previously received horse serum. The admission examination
should provide information from which the severity of the envenomation
can be estimated as a guide to the need for the administration
of antivenin and other therapy. Sensitivity tests should be
instituted promptly during admission if not previously begun.</p>
<p>When the patient enters the hospital, blood should be drawn immediately
for typing, matching and coagulation studies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>Although envenomation by one of the snakes of North America
may present severe signs and symptoms, death is rare except in
children or following envenomation by a large snake. However,
permanent damage of an involved extremity is frequent following
a bite by certain of the North American venomous snakes; plastic
or orthopedic surgical repair to restore function, or amputation,
are not unusual consequences. Early and continuing close observation
is needed to determine if certain therapeutic measures prevent or
promote undesirable results.</p>
<h5 id="c32"><i>Laboratory Tests</i></h5>
<p>No rigid set of rules regarding therapy can be justified; the responsible
physician must use his best judgment in his choice of tests
to be performed as a guide to procedures to be used.</p>
<p>Clinical studies could include items such as repeated hematologic
tests, hepatic and renal function studies, serial electrocardiograms,
electroencephalograms, and other studies to therapy, depending on
the composition of the venom involved and within the limits of
personnel, time and equipment available.</p>
<h5 id="c33"><i>Therapeutic Procedures</i></h5>
<h6 id="c34">A. Systemic</h6>
<blockquote>
<p>1. Immobilization. During transportation, admission procedures,
and most of the early hospitalization period, immobilization
of the affected part and absolute rest should be continued.
A sedative or analgesic may be administered to relieve restlessness
and anxiety; ice bags may be applied to alleviate severe pain. The
extremity should be immobilized in the position of function, and
active and passive exercises to prevent contracture started after
the third day if consistent with the patient&rsquo;s condition.</p>
<p>2. Blood Transfusion. Postmortem examinations have at times
revealed extensive retroperitonial and intraperitonial hemorrhage,
and hemorrhage into the viscera, including the liver and kidney.
Progressive decrease in the total volume of circulating red blood
cells has been attributed to the development of a massive hemolytic
anemia or internal hemorrhage. Blood transfusions may be
necessary and at times have been followed by marked improvement.
Studies of the several factors involved in blood clotting
may be useful as guides to treatment. The first and subsequent
specimens of urine should be especially examined for the presence
of red blood cells, hemoglobin, and protein.</p>
<p>3. Electrolyte Balance. Abnormality of fluid and electrolyte
balance should be detected and corrected on a continuing basis.</p>
<p>4. Antivenin. Polyvalent or specific antivenins prepared from
venoms of snakes in the same geographic area should be administered
in therapeutic quantity as recommended by the manufacturer
only with full realization that the hazard of immediate
allergic reaction or delayed serum sickness are factors to be evaluated
in the decision to carry out this type of treatment. During
hospitalization, antivenin should be given intravenously, provided
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
that sensitivity tests indicate that the patient is not allergic to the
antiserum to be used. Desensitization, if necessary, should precede
the administration of antivenin by any route. The use of antivenin
in such cases should be carefully evaluated. Injection in
normal muscles in other extremities would be the second choice,
since local injections into the deposit site do not diffuse efficiently
into the entire damaged area and would increase the hazard of
pressure ischemia leading to increased tissue necrosis. Epinephrine
should be available for immediate use when foreign protein is
being administered.</p>
<p>5. Corticosteroids. The use of corticosteroids should be restricted
to the prevention or treatment of late manifestations of allergy
following administration of antivenins.</p>
<p>6. Antibiotics. A broad-spectrum antibiotic should be administered
promptly in appropriate dosage if the reaction to envenomation
is severe. Since the nature of the injury markedly predisposes
to infection, and pathogenic bacteria are found in the
wound, this use of antibiotics seems justified. Laboratory sensitivity
tests, if available, should control the continuing choice of antibiotics
to be used. A massive wound infection with severe systemic
reaction could be mistaken for severe envenomation. Repeated
blood and wound cultures would be of help in making the
distinction.</p>
<p>7. Tetanus Prophylaxis. Tetanus toxoid should be administered
upon admission if it has not been given as a first aid measure.</p>
<p>8. Respiratory Paralysis. If respiratory paralysis develops following
envenomation by one of the <i>Elapidae</i> (this family includes
the coral snake), the use of tracheostomy and intermittent positive
pressure artificial respiration is indicated.</p>
<p>9. Renal Shutdown has been an occasional occurrence following
massive envenomation. An awareness of this possible complication
can do much toward the prevention and treatment of
secondary effects arising after its occurrence. Routine daily tests
such as B.U.N., CO&#8322; combining power, and serum potassium levels
are indicated in severe cases.</p>
</blockquote>
<h6 id="c35">B. Local Measures During Hospitalization</h6>
<blockquote>
<p>1. Tourniquet (Constricting band). A tourniquet applied following
a bite by a venomous North American snake should be
removed if envenomation seems mild or after a potent antivenin
is given in therapeutic quantity. The prolonged use of a tourniquet
or of a constricting band would increase local tissue damage
due to the action of venom and might delay the vascular transport
of antivenin into envenomated areas.</p>
<p>2. Incision and Suction. Substantial amounts of venom can be
removed during the first half-hour from subcutaneous deposits by
incision and suction. On the other hand, if the casualty is admitted
to the hospital one hour or more following envenomation,
an attempt to remove venom by incision and suction at the site
of the bite would be of little value. However, if marked subcutaneous
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
pitting edema develops, interstitial pressure can be
relieved by several longitudinal incisions extending into the subcutaneous
tissues. Suction and fasciotomy may be required at times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="tb">Parrish (1961), using a modification of Wood, Hoback and Green&rsquo;s
(1955) clinical classification of pit viper venenations, has proposed the
following guide for determining the severity of a poisonous snake
bite. This classification is based upon present signs and symptoms and
the clinical course of the patient during the first 12 hours of hospitalization.
It will be useful as a guide in treatment.</p>
<p class="book">Grade O (No venenation). Fang or tooth marks present, minimal
pain, less than one inch of surrounding edema and erythema,
and no systemic involvement.</p>
<p class="book">Grade I (Minimal venenation). Fang or tooth marks present, moderate
pain, from one to five inches surrounding edema and
erythema in the first 12 hours after bite, and no systemic
involvement.</p>
<p class="book">Grade II (Moderate venenation). Fang or tooth marks present,
severe pain, six to 12 inches of surrounding edema and erythema
in the first 12 hours after bite, with systemic involvement&mdash;nausea,
vomiting, giddiness, shock or neurotoxic symptoms
present.</p>
<p class="book">Grade III (Severe venenation). Fang or tooth marks present, severe
pain, more than 12 inches of surrounding edema and erythema
in the first 12 hours after bite, with systemic involvement
(as in Grade II).</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
